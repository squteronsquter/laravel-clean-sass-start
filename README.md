# laravel-clean-sass-start
Just strip default styling and bootstrap dependency styling with welcome.blade.php to app.scss

#### Create a new laravel project as you would always do

run npm installation and dev as well as php artisan serve

replace some of the default files and re-run npm run dev & php artisan serve

#### Three files are important:

webpack.mix.js
resources/sass/app.scss
resources/js/app.js
resources/views/welcome.blade.php

#### This is just for me so if you do not know what to do do not use it.
